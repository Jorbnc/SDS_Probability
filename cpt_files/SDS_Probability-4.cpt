\subsubsection{Probability Axioms}\topline
Nonnegativity: $P(A) \geq 0$, $A$ is any event. \\
Normalization: $P(\Omega) = 1 $ (the event here is $\Omega$, since every set is subset of itself).\\
(Finite) Additivity (\textit{to be strengthened later}): $A \cap B = \emptyset \implies P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$\\
\vspace{2mm}
The last axiom is going to be refined later\\
These 3 axioms are sufficient to have a legitimate \textbf{probability model}.
