\subsubsection{Multinomial Theorem}\topline
The expansion of $(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_r)^n$ will produce $r^n$ elements of the form $x_{1}^{n_1}x_{2}^{n_2}...x_{r}^{n_r}$ such that $\sum n_i = n$.
\vspace{1.5mm}\\
Some of these elements are identical and can be grouped exactly as those from the expansion in the Binomial Theorem.
\vspace{1.5mm}\\
This is equivalent to listing all the possible divisions of $n$ distinct elements into $r$ distinct groups of sizes $n_1, n_2, . . . , n_r$,
but there are more than one such combinations that add up to $n$, so:
\bcentering{(x_{1} + x_{2} + ... + x_{r})^n = \sum_{\substack{(n_1,...,n_r): \\ n_1+...+n_r=n}} \tbinom{n}{n_1,n_2,...,n_r} x_{_1}^{n_1} x_{_2}^{n_2} ... x_{_r}^{n_r}}
